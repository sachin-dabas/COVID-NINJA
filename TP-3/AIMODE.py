Source code for Fruit Ninja AI ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3vU9OdWAs ) 

The AI only loses when a bomb is overlapped with a fruit on its whole path, as the AI won't find a good opportunity to slice it.

The game as a chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fruit-ninja-game/fdkhnibpmdfmpgaipjiodbpdngccfibp

Simply place the chrome extension on the top right corner of your screen and run this file :) 

Some heuristics and timings might differ depending on your machine.
(too much/little computing time between frames might affect the AI's decisions)
