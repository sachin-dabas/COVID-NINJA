# COVID-NINJA
Covid Ninja is a computer-based videogame designed and coded in Python using the Tkinter visual library as part of the Final Project for Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science CS 15112.

Games are fun way to make exploration even more enjoyable. Practicing falling back behind the seat of consciousness can be challenging as the mind works to hijack raw awareness. During the last year, covid 19 affected the lives of millions of people. On one side we have to recover from this massive setback and beat the frustration but also create awareness and educate people and especially children about the measures to control it. Inspired by the complexity of Fruit Ninja, I was interested to make it as my Term project and hopefully release it so people can beat the frustration by killing these viruses. The game must cut various diseases — including CORONAVIRUS — before infecting a character. As the level progresses, diseases become more aggressive — just as diseases do in real life. Added Feature: Implemented Game AI using Computer Vision

## HOW TO PLAY?

The project is run by the Main.py file. The AI-main file is run by the 'Main.py' file itself and contains the AI component of the game. All the other files are supported files for the main class. The effects file contains all the code required for the pygame audio.  

The following list contains all the files:
- Main.py
- AI.py
- Effects.py
- Virus.py
- Viruses.py
- Audio Files (.mp3 + .wav)
- clipFunction
- Cmu_112_graphics.py
- Point.py
- polygon Centroid.py
- SpecialItems.py

## REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

The following libraries are required:
- PIL
- cmu_112_graphics
- Pygame (for audio)
- datetime
- cv2
- numpy
- pywin32
- Threading
- pyAutoGUI
- mss
